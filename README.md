# CBCTChat - A Content-Aware Chatbot Based on GPT-4 for the German S2 Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) Dental Imaging Guideline

## Introduction

**CBCTChat** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to offer insights and information on the German S2 Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) dental imaging guideline. Utilizing the capabilities of LLamaIndex combined with OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 models, this chatbot delivers answers grounded in specialized knowledge through an embedding-based knowledge retrieval method.

## Features

- **QA Queries**: The system can query CBCTChat based on GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 models, retrieving context-based answers in a Question-Answer style.
- **German Language**: Designed with German language prompts for seamless integration with the German S2 CBCT guideline.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook**: An easy-to-use Jupyter notebook that allows users to create an index, set parameters, and view results of CBCTChat.
- **PDF Metadata Extraction**: Extracts metadata from the guideline PDF, enabling context for the AI's responses.
